# NAS6LIB: A Versatile Mathematical Library for 3D Graphics and Celestial Mechanics  
  
NAS6LIB is a robust and versatile JavaScript library engineered for **rigorous mathematical computations**  
in 3D graphics and celestial mechanics. It provides foundational tools for precise calculations related  
to vectors, matrices, and quaternions, essential for accurately modeling various physical phenomena.  
  
The `solarsystem.htm` demonstration, built upon NAS6LIB, offers an immersive platform to **visually explore  
the dynamics of our solar system**. It goes beyond simple visualization by allowing users to  
**compare different computational models** for celestial motion.

### Interactive Solar System Exploration  
  
The `solarsystem.htm` application provides a highly interactive experience for exploring planetary orbits and positions.  
Users have granular control over the simulation parameters:  
  
* **Custom Time Setting**: Set the simulation to any desired date and time.  
* **Adjustable Speed & Scale**: Control how fast time progresses in the simulation and adjust  
the visual scale of the solar system for better perspective.  
* **Forward and Reverse Playback**: Navigate through time both forwards and backwards  
to observe orbital paths and planetary alignments.  
* **Focus on Any Planet**: Select any celestial body to be the center of attention,  
making it easier to observe its specific orbit and interactions.

### Customizable Orbital Mechanics Models  
  
A key feature of the `solarsystem.htm` demo is the ability to choose between different models for calculating celestial positions:  
  
* **Keplerian Calculation**: This mode uses **Kepler's laws of planetary motion** for a classical approximation of orbits.  
It's computationally lighter and provides an excellent fundamental understanding of orbital mechanics.  
* **Relativistic Runge-Kutta Method**: For a more advanced and accurate simulation, users can switch to  
the **Runge-Kutta numerical integration method**, which incorporates **relativistic effects**  
for gravity-based many-body problems. This allows for observing subtle phenomena, such as Mercury's anomalous perihelion precession,  
which cannot be explained by classical mechanics alone.  
  
This choice allows users to directly compare the outputs of classical and relativistic physics in a tangible way.
